# ProjectEuler.net problem set

These are my Scala solutions to the Project Euler problem set. All credit goes to the [Project Euler website](https://projecteuler.net/archives) which is where I adapted the problems descriptions from.

Problems in this repository are ordered according to the Project Euler's id numbering. Package P01 represents problems with an id of 1, and so on.
